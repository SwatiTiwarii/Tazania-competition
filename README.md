The competiton works on data provided by Tanzanian Ministry of Water and we have to determine the condition of water pumps.
We have to create a classification model to predict whether a given handpump is defective or not. 

First notebook describes exploratory data analysis on raw data. The correlation and patterns of different features with respect to target feature is observed. Subsequent notebooks contain details on missing value imputations, feature engineering and iterations of Random Forest and LightGBM classifier.
